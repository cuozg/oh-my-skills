name: goal-verify
description: "Verify one goal by checking every acceptance criterion one by one against the codebase. Do not batch-verify criteria. Searches repo for code/test evidence and generates structured test reports with per-criterion verdicts. Use after goal-execute to validate implementation. Auto-triages quick vs deep mode."

# goal-verify

Third gate in the goals pipeline.

```
goal-create   →   goal-improve   →   goal-execute   →   goal-verify
  write          critique          execute          verify
```

`goal-create` defines what "done" means. `goal-execute` builds it. **`goal-verify`
answers the single question**: *did we actually meet the acceptance
criteria we wrote down?* If the criteria themselves are weak, `goal-improve`
critiques and improves the goal before another execution pass.

The skill is deliberately read-only against the target repo (it writes
**only** the test report). It never edits source, never marks criteria
complete, never updates `Master.md`. Those actions belong to other skills.

---

## The Iron Law

> **Every acceptance criterion gets one verdict — `✅ Met`, `⚠️ Partial`,
> or `❌ Unmet` — backed by file-path evidence or an explicit
> "no evidence found" note. No verdict is handwaved.**

If you cannot produce evidence for a criterion, it is `❌ Unmet`. Period.
Do not trust a checked goal checkbox as proof. `- [x]` means the goal author
claimed completion, but `goal-verify` must independently verify implementation
or test evidence before returning `✅ Met`.

---

## Document Export Contract

**Every `goal-verify` run MUST:**

1. Parse one goal file at `Docs/Goals/<feature>/<task>.md`.
2. Extract YAML frontmatter (`status`, `priority`, `created`, `updated`,
   `depends_on`) and the `## Acceptance Criteria` checklist.
3. For each criterion, produce a verdict and evidence.
4. Write the report to `Docs/Goals/{feature-name}/{kebab-case-test}.md` (path
   derived from the goal's location under `Docs/Goals/`).
5. Return the counts `{total, met, partial, unmet}` on stdout.

**Every `goal-verify` run MUST NOT:**

- Edit the goal file itself (use `goal-create` for that).
- Mark checkboxes `- [x]` (use `goal-create` or `goal-improve`).
- Update `Docs/Goals/Master.md` (derived by `goal-create`).
- Write source code or tests (use the domain-specific skills).
- Run the project's test suite (out of scope — see Non-Goals).

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1 · Parse

Input: path to a goal file under `Docs/Goals/`.

```bash
python skills/goal-verify/scripts/parse_goal.py Docs/Goals/search/add-full-text-search.md
```

Produces a structured dict:

```json
{
  "path": "Docs/Goals/search/add-full-text-search.md",
  "title": "[Search] Add Full-Text Search",
  "frontmatter": {"status": "in-progress", "priority": "high", ...},
  "sections": {"Objective": "...", "Context": "...", "Constraints": "...", "Notes": "..."},
  "acceptance_criteria": [
    {"text": "GET /api/search?q=<term> returns ...", "checked": false, "line_no": 23},
    ...
  ],
  "warnings": []
}
```

Surface `warnings` to the user if any appear (missing frontmatter keys,
invalid status, zero checkboxes).

### Phase 2 · Verify

For each criterion, the verifier:

1. Extracts candidate **paths**, **code spans** (`` `foo` ``), **quoted
   literals**, **symbols** (CamelCase or `snake_case` identifiers), and
   fallback **keywords**.
2. Checks path existence inside the repo.
3. Searches implementation files in the active project while excluding goal docs, generated eval workspaces, backups, dependency folders, and skill/reference artifacts.
4. Scans test files anywhere under the repo for files mentioning any extracted symbol.
5. Emits a verdict:

| Verdict | When |
|---------|------|
| `✅ Met` | Relevant implementation evidence exists **AND** matching test file(s) exist |
| `⚠️ Partial` | Relevant implementation/path evidence exists but tests are missing or paths are partially absent |
| `❌ Unmet` | No referenced path exists, or no relevant code/test evidence exists |

### Phase 3 · Report

```bash
python skills/goal-verify/scripts/run_tests.py \
    Docs/Goals/search/add-full-text-search.md \
    --root . \
    --mode quick
```

Writes `Docs/Goals/search/add-full-text-search-test.md` with:

- YAML frontmatter (`kind: test-report`, `pass_rate`, `test_coverage`, …)
- Echoed **Objective**
- **Criteria Matrix** (one row per criterion)
- **Summary** (counts + pass rate + test coverage)
- **Test Results** (per-criterion detail with evidence)
- **Recommendations** (one bullet per gap)

See `references/test-template.md` for a filled example.

### Mode selection

- `--mode quick` (default for ≤5 criteria): concise evidence, first 2
  code hits per criterion.
- `--mode deep` (default for ≥10 criteria): full evidence, up to 5 code
  hits per criterion, richer recommendations.

If omitted, mode is inferred from criteria count.

## End-to-End Example

Goal file (`Docs/Goals/auth/add-jwt-auth.md`):

```markdown
---
status: in-progress
priority: high
created: 2026-04-15
updated: 2026-04-19
depends_on: []
---

# [Auth] Add JWT Authentication

## Objective
Protect API routes with stateless JWT auth.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] `POST /api/auth/login` returns `{token}` on valid credentials
- [x] Middleware `requireAuth` rejects requests without a valid token with `401`
- [ ] Tokens expire after 24h
- [ ] Documented in `docs/auth.md`
```

Run:

```bash
python skills/goal-verify/scripts/run_tests.py Docs/Goals/auth/add-jwt-auth.md
```

Output (excerpt):

```
✓ report: Docs/Goals/auth/add-jwt-auth-test.md
  2 met · 1 partial · 1 unmet · 4 total
```

The generated report includes:

```markdown
## Criteria Matrix

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|---|-----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `POST /api/auth/login` returns `{token}` on valid credentials | ✅ Met | `src/routes/auth.ts:14`, test: `tests/auth.test.ts` |
| 2 | Middleware `requireAuth` rejects requests without a valid token with `401` | ✅ Met | `src/middleware/requireAuth.ts:9`, test: `tests/middleware.test.ts` |
| 3 | Tokens expire after 24h | ⚠️ Partial | `src/routes/auth.ts:22` (no matching tests) |
| 4 | Documented in `docs/auth.md` | ❌ Unmet | referenced path(s) missing: `['docs/auth.md']` |
```

## Integration With the Pipeline

| Upstream skill | What it produces | goal-verify reads |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| `goal-create` | `Docs/Goals/<feature>/<task>.md` with frontmatter + criteria | goal file |
| `goal-execute` | Commits that implement those criteria | the repo state |

| Downstream skill | What it produces | goal-verify provides |
|------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| `goal-improve` | Goal critique and rewritten goal criteria | ambiguous or low-quality criteria |

**Typical flow:**

1. `goal-create` creates `Docs/Goals/search/add-full-text-search.md`.
2. `goal-execute` lands commits on a feature branch.
3. `goal-verify` writes `Docs/Goals/search/add-full-text-search-test.md`.
4. If any `❌`/`⚠️` comes from implementation gaps, run `goal-execute` again with the concrete findings.
5. If any `❌`/`⚠️` comes from vague, untestable, or poorly designed criteria, run `goal-improve` before another execution pass.

## Rules

1. **One goal per run.** Never batch-test multiple goals in a single
   invocation; each gets its own report for clean diffing.
2. **Report path is deterministic.** `Docs/Goals/{feature-name}/{task}.md` →
   `Docs/Goals/{feature-name}/{task}-test.md`. Never write anywhere else
   unless `--out` is explicit.
3. **One criterion at a time.** Verify each acceptance criterion independently.
   Do not merge, group, summarize, or batch criteria into a shared verdict.
4. **Never edit the goal file.** Even if a criterion is obviously
   satisfied, `goal-verify` does not mark it `- [x]`. Author attestation
   is the goal owner's job.
5. **Evidence or no evidence — never opinion.** If the verifier cannot
   find evidence, say so. Do not guess based on file names.
6. **Respect `--root`.** All path checks and searches happen under
   `--root` (default: current directory). A goal file outside the repo
   is still parsed, but searches stay inside the repo.
7. **Warn loudly on malformed goals.** Missing frontmatter keys, invalid
   `status` or `priority` values, or zero checkboxes surface as
   `warnings` in the parser output.
8. **Relevant evidence only.** Exclude `Docs/Goals`, generated `*-workspace` folders,
   backups, dependency folders, and unrelated skill/reference artifacts from proof. Broad
   words such as `Search`, `Results`, or `implementation` are not sufficient evidence
   unless they appear in implementation or test files tied to the criterion. Documentation
   files can support path checks, but they are not implementation proof by themselves.
9. **Stdlib only.** Scripts must not import third-party packages. YAML
   frontmatter is parsed by hand; ripgrep is optional.
10. **Deterministic output.** Running `goal-verify` twice on an unchanged
   repo yields byte-identical reports, modulo the `generated` timestamp.

---

## Non-Goals

- **Running unit or integration tests.** Use the project's own runner
  (`pytest`, `npm test`, `go test`, `dotnet test`). `goal-verify` only
  *locates* test files; it does not execute them.
- **Writing new tests.** Use `flutter-test`, `unity-test-unit`, or the
  equivalent for your stack.
- **Mutating `Master.md` or checkboxes.** Handled by `goal-create` and
  `goal-improve`.
- **Code review.** Use `unity-review`, `flutter-review`, or the matching
  review skill.
