# Formula and Citation Rules

## Formula requirements
- Use formulas for derived values rather than hardcoding results.
- Do not use dynamic array functions like `FILTER`, `XLOOKUP`, `SORT`, or `SEQUENCE`.
- Keep formulas simple and legible; use helper cells for complex logic.
- Avoid volatile functions like `INDIRECT` and `OFFSET` unless required.
- Prefer cell references over magic numbers (e.g., `=H6*(1+$B$3)` instead of `=H6*1.04`).
- Use absolute (`$B$4`) or relative (`B4`) references carefully so copied formulas behave correctly.
- If you need literal text that starts with `=`, prefix it with a single quote.
- Guard against `#REF!`, `#DIV/0!`, `#VALUE!`, `#N/A`, and `#NAME?` errors.
- Check for off-by-one mistakes, circular references, and incorrect ranges.

## Citation requirements
- Cite sources inside the spreadsheet using plain-text URLs.
- For financial models, cite model inputs in cell comments.
- For tabular data sourced externally, add a source column when each row represents a separate item.
