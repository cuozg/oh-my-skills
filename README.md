# Oh My OpenCode - Unity Agent Configuration

Configuration files for AI agents to work effectively with this Unity project.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cuozg/oh-my-unity.git ./.opencode
```
```

## Quick Start

1. **Code Review**: *"Review PR #25141 for performance issues."* (uses `unity-review-pr`)
2. **Fix Errors**: *"Fix the compiler errors in the console."* (uses `unity-fix-errors`)
3. **Plan & Implement**: *"Add a player health bar to the UI."* (uses `unity-plan`)
4. **Investigate**: *"How does the matchmaking system work?"* (uses `unity-investigate`)
5. **Refactor**: *"Simplify the coupling in PlayerManager."* (uses `unity-refactor`)

## Rules

**Location**: `.opencode/rules/`

Rules define project-wide conventions that all agents must follow:

| Rule | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `agent-behavior.md` | Agent interaction patterns and constraints |
| `unity-csharp-conventions.md` | C# coding style, naming, and patterns |
| `unity-asset-rules.md` | Asset management, prefab, and scene conventions |

---

## Skills

**Location**: `.opencode/skills/`

Skills are **specialized capabilities** that extend the agent's expertise. Each skill lives in its own folder with a flat structure (`skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`) and is discovered automatically by the `opencode-agent-skills` plugin via YAML frontmatter.
